# paradox-gpt-discord-bot
This JavaScript script creates a bot for Discord using the discord.js library and integrates it with OpenAI's GPT-4 model using OpenAI's Node.js library. The bot listens to incoming messages in a specific Discord channel, carries a conversation with users using OpenAI's model, and responds back in the same channel.
